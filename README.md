- 👋 Hi, I’m @Akshayatyagi
- 👀 I have a profound fascination for the synergy between Data Science and AI, and my passion is further amplified when applied to the realm of Public Health.
- 🌱 Currently, I am diligently immersing myself in the world of Data Science, starting from the basics and building a solid foundation of knowledge. Simultaneously, I am also actively engaged in studying Public Health, seeking to deepen my understanding of its principles and practices.
- 💞️ I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities on diverse projects aimed at addressing real-time challenges. While my primary interest lies in Public Health/Healthcare, I am open to exploring and contributing to projects spanning different domains. 
- 📫  Please feel free to reach out to me via Gmail(akshay.tyagi1601@gmail.com). I'm excited to explore the possibilities of collaboration and contribute my skills to make a meaningful impact together.
